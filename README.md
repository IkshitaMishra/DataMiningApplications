# Yelp Data Mining and Applications

Undertook a data mining course wherein we mined massive dataset and generated some hidden patterns. Large dataset was handled using Apache Spark, where in all data were loaded in resilient distributed datasets.
Also made use of Spark Machine Learning libraries and worked with graphs for community Detection. We also streamed twitter data and solved an various problem statements.

1) Intoduction to Yelp Data Analysis using Pyspark.

2) Finding Frequent Bussiness Pairs in Yelp dataset using SON Algorithm

3) Implement Collaborative Filtering Recommendation system suing following algorithms:

    a) Locality Sensitive Hashing using Jaccard Based Similarity.
    
    b) User Based Collaborative Filtering Pearson Correlation Similarity.
    
    c) Item Based Collaborative Filtering using Pearson Correlation Similarity.
    
    d) Model Based Collaborative Filtering - Alternating Least Squares.
    
    e) Item Based Collaborative Filtering using Locality Sensitive Hashing using Jaccard Based Similarity.

4) Community Detection (Social Network Analysis) - Girvan Newman Algorithm.

5) Clustering Alforithm - Bradley, Fayyad and Reina (BFR) algorithm.

6) Twitter Streaming :

    a) Resevior Algorithm 
    
    b) Bloom Filtering 
    
    c) Flajolet Algorithm 
    
 7) Hybrid Collaborative Filtering : Alternating Least Squares (ALS) Matrix Factorizationa and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Matrix Factorization recommendation system.
